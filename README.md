# Cypress Learn

This repo is comprised of two learning projects provided via [learn.cypress.io](https://learn.cypress.io/). The starter repos provided give you an already built application/project, and you focus solely on the testing.

## Realworld Testing Course App

This exercise takes you through writing your first tests with Cypress - the [course](https://learn.cypress.io/testing-your-first-application/app-install-and-overview) takes you through the process of beginning e2e testing, from cloning the provided starter repo to installing Cypress and how to setup the test runner.

Please checkout the [README](cypress-realworld-testing-course-app/README.md) for this exercise for more information, and some of my additional thoughts and notes.

## Realworld Testing Blog

This exercise focusses on building skills with Cypress commands; you're provided with Practice tests and instructions - and Answer files if you need them.

Please checkout the [README](cypress-realworld-testing-blog/README.md) for this exercise to see further details.
